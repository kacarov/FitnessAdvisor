What problems did the application have before you started refactoring?

	- The main problem that we had was that our Engine class was implementing Singleton design pattern.
	- BodyCalculator class was static.
	- No Unit tests at all.
	
What design patterns have you used and why?

	-We used factory pattern so we can stick to Single responsibility principle
